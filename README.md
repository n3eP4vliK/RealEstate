**Project Description:**

**Introduction:**
This project utilizes data from the Real Estate service, encompassing an extensive archive of property listings for sale in St. Petersburg and its adjacent regions spanning several years. The primary objective is to determine the market value of real estate properties and identify the key factors influencing their valuation. Additionally, we aim to identify the top ten populated areas with the highest number of property listings and analyze the average price per kilometer within the city of St. Petersburg while examining its dependence on proximity to the city center.

**Research Objectives:**
1. Determine the Market Value of Real Estate Properties: The central goal of this study is to establish a robust methodology for estimating the market value of residential properties. This involves examining various attributes and factors that contribute to property valuation.

2. Identify Top Populated Areas: We intend to identify and rank the top ten populated areas within the dataset based on the volume of property listings. This will provide insights into the most active real estate markets.

3. Analyze Price Dependency on Distance: We will investigate the relationship between property value and its distance from the city center. This analysis will involve calculating the average price per kilometer in St. Petersburg.

**Research Process:**

1. Data Overview: We will commence with an in-depth examination of the provided dataset, located in the file "/datasets/real_estate_data.csv." This initial step will help us understand the quality and structure of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: To ensure data accuracy and reliability, we will perform comprehensive data preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions, and addressing any potential anomalies that could affect the accuracy of our analysis.

3. Calculations and Data Enhancement: We will compute additional metrics and parameters relevant to our research objectives and integrate these results into the dataset for subsequent analysis.

4. Exploratory Analysis: In this phase, we will conduct an exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data. This will involve visualizations, statistical summaries, and hypothesis testing to understand patterns and relationships within the dataset.

5. General Conclusion: Finally, we will draw conclusions based on our findings, addressing the research objectives and offering insights into the market dynamics of real estate properties in St. Petersburg and its vicinity.

This structured approach will guide the research process, ensuring that the objectives are met, and meaningful insights are derived from the analysis of the real estate data.
